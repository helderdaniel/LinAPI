#-5

Test to pass parameters for reference rather than pointer to Fortran functions
as in:

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=235&start=0

extern "C" void dgeqrf_ (const int &m, const int &n, double da[], const int &lda, double dtau[], double dwork[], const int &ldwork, int &info)

#-4 Fix Singleton pattern in LinApi as describet in comment in LinApi.cpp

#-3 Bug in distributed exception handling crashes system (Scalapack only)
========================================================================
It must handle:
	Only one proc throws exception
	More than one or all procs throws exceptions
	No execption thrown (normal termination)

without glibc memory error

this can be seen easly with:   . run scast 7 (even if no exception throw) 

To read output before error on termination, client program can have a 
getchar() before end of program.

Problem could be on MPI comm functions, or on LinApi use of functions


#-2 Terminar implementao Scalapack (e parte do Lapack)
desde o teste a daxpy no exemplo LinApiEx01
==================================================

A implementao dos operadores + += * *= n forma feitas para todos os tipos
SINGLE, DOUBLE, ...
pode-se usar a mesma tecnica usada no LinSolver gesv, que evita duplicao
de todo o codigo das funcoes, usando uma funcao generica wrapper para gemv_
e gemm_

#-1 When linking lapack examples with shared linapi
===================================================

it can find reference to methods.
However nm liblinapi.so.1 reports them there

#0 Support for (Triangular, sym, herm, ...) Matrices
===============================================
(Must group all Blacs P/BALS - Sca/Lapack function according to MAtrix type
 on a paper sheet to identify classes nedded)

Class LinMatrixTR for triangular (or tridiagonal??) matricies
(and classes for sym, herm, too?)
Use speclialized P/BLAS functions for calc

The only diff between this classes and LinMatrix is the P/Blas Sca/Lapack
functions called

(Scalapack)
collect and distribute (for triangular matrices) must be overloaded 
to use specallized functions (from scalapack tools for trapezoidal matrices)

Solver class must also have a function for this kind of matrices?


#1 Compare operator == on base class Operator2D
===============================================

write how to make == operator on distributed env:
	DO NOT check locally all fields
	we are not tring to id if its same object (only same value)
	DO check locally all dynamic arrays
	if ok value == true
	else value = false
	send all values to every other processors
	check if any false
	else globaloperator == is true

this is not quite the same used for exception handling on LinApi
where all other processes send a signa to the root processor
In this case all processor must send a boolean value (or an int) to all
others

Maybe there is an MPI collective comm function to do this
or even blacs broadcast (MPI should be better)


#2 type conversion, between Sca/Lapack data types
=================================================

   DOUBLE, SINGLE, COMPLEX, ....

	this support is not yet available.
	One way to do implement that support can be defining specialized
	constructors for type convertion like:

	LinMatrix<DOUBLE>(SINGLE Op)

	which creates a new matrix LinMatrix<Double> object
	and copies Op._data to this._data

	Then C++ type convertion constructor can be called automatically
	in operations like:

	LinMatrix<DOUBLE> A
	LinMatrix<SINGLE> B

	LinMatrix<DOUBLE> C = A + B
